# CS361 Microservice A 

## Request Data 
As part of a term long project, I worked in collaboration with [Joel Gilger](https://github.com/jgiggler) to create a Flask app that helps manage a library database system. 
Users are able to perform CRUD operations on various tables which include, one-to-one, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships.
Here is an overview of the project which discusses the database outline, schema, and includes screenshots of the UI: [CS340 Project
](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjbcS9OL6N6IfLD_cm-4Dt98i-0t2rQta1I2JeIUrxw/edit?usp=sharing).

## Receive Data 
In order to view this project, the user must be on OSU's VPN or physically connected to the on campus internet. You can find information on connecting to the VPN [here
](https://oregonstate.edu/).

The MySQL database you will be using for the project will also need to be created. In the course, this was done using phpMyAdmin.
